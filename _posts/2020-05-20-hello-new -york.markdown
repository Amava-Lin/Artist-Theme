<h2> Introduction </h2>  <!-- style="color: #9FA8DA" -->

Hello there! My name is Sara and I'm a 28-year-old tech enthusiast based in New York who's learning the ropes of web dev. I've played around with html and web design since I was a young kit, back before I really understood what it was. 

Those were the days of <b><span style="color: #4480bb">x</span><span style="color: #f38522">a</span><span style="color: #b62025">n</span><span style="color: #f7c021">g</span><span style="color: #4db848">a</span></b> <span style="color: grey"><i>(circa 2004)</i></span> where my only aim was to have the <span style="color: blue"><b>coolest</b></span> colors, fonts, and custom formatting ever. The old <b><span style="color: #4480bb">x</span><span style="color: #f38522">a</span><span style="color: #b62025">n</span><span style="color: #f7c021">g</span><span style="color: #4db848">a</span></b> gave full access to add images, headers, backgrounds, and to change what we pleased. I remember spending hours fine tuning embedded scrolling notifications, music players, and page animations. Even though it was years later, I was absolutely crushed when <b><span style="color: #4480bb">x</span><span style="color: #f38522">a</span><span style="color: #b62025">n</span><span style="color: #f7c021">g</span><span style="color: #4db848">a</span></b>'s services closed down. So many important memories were tied to that online experience, and I felt like part of my childhood had disappeared. 

So I guess this is my way of expanding on that, grown-up style. Two parts nostalgia, one part self-improvement. A lot has evolved in the web dev realm since then, but it's fun to see how some basic html that I remember from my teenage years remains the same. 

Anyways, welcome to my site and feel free to look around!
