After working in behavioral health for over five years, I found myself at a career crossroads. In order to grow as a clinician and improve my ability to help others, it was time to pursue a masterâ€™s degree. But the field I most wanted to branch into was not exactly in line with my previous education; as it turned out, I had to take 9 prerequisite courses to qualify for MS programs in Occupational Therapy. I decided that in the long haul, committing myself to a few more years of study would be more than worth it. And the sooner the better!

As an entering graduate student, I am currently inspired by three areas related to Occupational Therapy: (1) environmental adaptations & equipment to promote safety, independence, and ability in the home, (2) neurotechnological advancements in the field, and (3) the development of more effective assessments & monitoring tools regarding harmful effects of neuroleptic drugs in conjunction with proactive psychosocial supports to promote mental health.

What's great about OT is that it really bleeds into all aspects of daily functioning in life. As such, there still remain vast depths to explore. An OT could work through the lens of developmental disability, or researching and applying treatments for dementia, implementing assessments and preventative measures for various cognitive and sensory impairments, or as a means of enabling accessability in the community . With the road wide open in front of me, who knows which route I'll go!
