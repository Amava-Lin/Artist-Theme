After working in behavioral health for over five years, I found myself at a career crossroads. In order to grow as a clinician and improve my ability to help others, it was time to pursue a masterâ€™s degree. But the field I most wanted to branch into was not exactly in line with my previous education; as it turned out, I had to take 9 prerequisite courses to qualify for MS programs in Occupational Therapy. I decided that in the long haul, committing myself to a few more years of study would be more than worth it. And the sooner the better!

As an entering graduate student, I am currently inspired by three areas related to Occupational Therapy: (1) environmental equipment and adaptations to promote independence and ability in the home, (2) the combined study of sensorimotor input and neurological developments, and (3) technological advancements in the field. 

However, the great thing about OT is that it really bleeds into all aspects of daily functioning in life. You could be an OT working through the lens of developmental disability, or understanding and applying treatments for dementia, implementing assessments and preventative measures for various cognitive and sensory deficits, or as a means of psychosocial support to promote mental health. With the road wide open in front of me, who knows which way I'll go!
