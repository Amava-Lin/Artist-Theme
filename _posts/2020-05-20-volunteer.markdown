During my student observations, I was exposed to an OTR trained in Neurodevelopmental Treatment (NDT). Treatments such as these especially appeal to me in their integration of sensorimotor input and neurological development. Some of the integrative services we discussed included Interactive Metronome Training and Tomatisâ€™ auditory stimulation therapy. These non-invasive methods are incredibly exciting and deserve more attention, research, and administrative support to determine & secure accessibility through health insurance. 

Prior to the start of the school year, I hope to expand my volunteer activity further. Some of my previous experiences include:
