The theme for this site was created by <a href="https://github.com/ninapetrop/" target="_blank">Nina Petropoulos</a> on GitHub. It is powered by Jekyll, a quick-start templating tool for static sites. Gulp is implemented as an automation tool. I used <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">MS Visual Studio Code</a> to personalize the site and edit old formatting. This primarily involved working with .html and .sass files. Some minor scripting in javascript was involved as well. 

Currently, my site is hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>, which turned out to be a fun, accessible way to get started in web dev. I would defintely recommend a basic setup like this for anyone starting out. There are a variety of free <a href="https://jekyllthemes.io/free/" target="_blank">Jekyll themes</a> that give you a really great place to start. 

Enjoy!
